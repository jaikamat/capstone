Your Goal: 
On each level, you must program your avatar to collect all the Crystals and land at the Portal. In levels where there are no Crystals, your Avatar just needs to get to the Portal.

Select a Level:
Levels rank from Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced to Expert. It is recommended that you complete the levels in order.

Write Your Program:
To write your program, place the colored Action Tokens onto the indicated Guide Scroll. The Guide Scroll acts as a program controller that will guide your Avatar acress the colored paths of the Map to pick up the Crystals and land at the Portal.

Here are some things to consider as your write your program:
1. You must fill all the spaces on the Guide Scroll. Your job is to figure out the order to place each Action Token on the Guide Scroll.
2. The color of each token tells your Avatar which colored path to follow on the map.
3. When your Avatar lands on a location with a Crystal, you will automatically collect it.
4. In some levels, your Avatar will land on a location that contains more than one Crystal. However, you will only collect one Cyrstal at a time. To collect the remaining Crystal(s), you'll need to plan a path that causes you to leave that tile and return, revisiting that location as many times as needed to collect all the Crystals.
5. If the level has no Crystals, your goal is simply to get your avatar to finish at the Portal.
6. Your Avatar must run through the full program. If you reach the Portal before you get to the end of the Guide Scroll, you must continue the program by moving him according to the remaining Action Token(s).

Run Your Program:
Once you have filled your Guide Scroll and are confident that you have a successful program, try running it to see how it works. If your Avatar reaches the Portal on the Map, has collected all the Crystals, AND you are at the end of your Guide Scroll, YOU WIN!! Now you can proceed to the next Level.

Debug Your Program:
Sometimes you may think that a program is going to work, but when you run it, something goes wrong. That's okay, just reset the level and try again with a different program. Which tokens are you sure about, and which ones can be swapped? Check the Map for other possible pathways.

You know your program is broken and needs to be debugged if:
* Your next Action Token says to follow a certain colored path, but there are no paths of that color available where your Avatar is currently placed
* You reach the end of the program and your Avatar isn't at the Portal.
* You reach the end of your program and your Avatar is at the Portal, but you haven't collected all the Crystals.

Special Paths:
    * One Way paths indicate that your Avatar can only move in the same direction the arrows are pointing.
    * Loop paths bring your Avatar right back to your current location.

Action Tokens Defined:
    * Red Tokens allow your Avatar to move between two locations that are connected along a red path on the Map.
    * Green Tokens allow your Avatar to move between two locations that are connected along a green path on the Map.
    * Blue Tokens allow your Avatar to move between two locations that are connected along a blue path on the Map.

Conditional Tokens:
Once you get to the intermediate levels, you'll notice that some of the Guide Scrolls have hexagon-shaped spaces. These are for Conditional Tokens.

Conditional Tokens depict a yes-no question that will determine which instruction to execute next on the Guide Scroll.

If you answer "No" to a question, follow the arrows leading from the red "X". If you answer "Yes", follow the arrows leading from the green "√".

Conditional Tokens Defined:
    Crystal Collected Tokens:
    These tokens as how many Crystals you have collected on your current level. If you have the exact number (in this case, 2), follow the Guide Scroll arrow with the green "√". If not, follow the arrow with the red "X".

    Orange Troll Token:
    This token asks if there is an Orange Troll on the current Location your Avatar is on. If there is, follow the Guide Scroll arrow with the green "√". If not, follow the arrow with the red "x".

    Purple Troll Token:
    This token asks if there is an Purple Troll on the current Location your Avatar is on. If there is, follow the Guide Scroll arrow with the green "√". If not, follow the arrow with the red "x".

Writing a program with Conditional Tokens:
Just as before, all the spaces on the Guide Scroll must be filled. When placing a Conditional Token note that:
    1. If the level has only one Conditional Token (and, therefore, one hexagonal space) you know where to place that token.
    2. If there is more than one Conditional Token your job is a little trickier; you must decide which Conditional Token goes on which hexagon shaped space.
